## Hi there, I'm Philip 👋
🛠️ SRE/DevOps | System Administrator | CNCF Zealot

I have an old-school background in traditional System Administration, first using RedHat Linux & FreeBSD in 1999. As a System Administrator I have overseen the management of essential infrastructure components, including Backup, Database, Mail, and Web servers, among others, serving as the workhorses of the internet. In my current position, I handle DevOps responsibilities, looking to “automate all the things” with a very strong interest in Kubernetes & CNCF technologies.

In my free time, I am a perpetual student always learning. I also chair a community BMX/Dirt bike jump park [dirtti.org](https://dirtti.org) in Joenssu, Finland.
